                I once knew a man whose life was built only around himself. He spoke as if the world revolved around his desires, and every choice he made was measured by what he could gain. When others helped him, he rarely showed gratitude, and when they needed support, he always had an excuse to walk away. His selfishness slowly pushed people away, leaving him surrounded by silence. In the end, he had everything he wanted but no one to share it with, and that was the price of his self-centered life.
